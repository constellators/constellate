# Constellate Roadmap / Todo

 - [ ] BUILD - Chokidar events should result in the absolute minimal amount of work being done. e.g. transpile a single file. remove a dir, etc
 - [ ] BUILD - Build process for Node bundles should have a secondary process that copies across non-JS files.
 - [X] CHORE - Move constellate configuration into `constellate.js` files.
 - [ ] COMMAND - Create project command
