# Constellate Roadmap / Todo

allow plugin extension API?
use bin-up to create some project specific commands
getLastVersion on a project with no version should return 0.0.0?

 - [ ] BUG! - nodeVersion needs to allow partials i.e. 4 instead of 4.x.x
 - [X] BUG! - Need to rework the versioning/publishing process. We will have to update the source package.json files directly in order to ensure correct publishing chain reactions.
 - [X] BUG! - When a project is published, all their dependants need to be published too.
 - [X] BUG! - Develop fails when having not previously built the projects and your are building a web client that depends on another constellate project. Mouthful.
 - [X] CHORE - replace cross-spawn with execa
 - [X] CHORE - move constellate-utils into it's own repo
 - [X] CHORE - Change this constellate repo back over to node 8 and update eslint config accordingly.
 - [X] CHORE - Move constellate configuration into `constellate.js` files.
 - [X] CHORE - refactor utils from constellate -> constellate-dev-utils
 - [ ] COMMAND - Create project

 - [X] DEVELOP - Dependency based reloads.
 - [ ] DOCS
   - [ ] Intro
   - [ ] Video overview
   - [ ] Blog post
   - [ ] SIGTERM effective usage
   - [ ] constellate.js
 - [ ] FEATURE - allow a "script" compiler type, with compilerOptions allowing you to target a script
 - [ ] FEATURE - Validate the constellate configuration (tcomb?)
 - [ ] FEATURE - Copy some base files across always - .npmignore, /README(.md)?/i
 - [ ] FEATURE - Copy across non-JS files when compiling
 - [ ] FEATURE - Allow for additional files to be specified in package.json files
 - [ ] FEATURE - Support NPM tags.
 - [ ] FEATURE - Make the target browserlist configurable.
 - [ ] FEATURE - BrowserList configuration (touch point in babel and webpack config)
 - [ ] FEATURE - Chokidar events should result in the absolute minimal amount of work being done. e.g. transpile a single file. remove a dir, etc
 - [ ] FEATURE - auto-add source-map-support to build dependencies, and then re-enable for production builds.
 - [ ] FEATURE - plugin interface for compilers - pre/post compile
 - [ ] FEATURE - plugin interface for compilers - pre/post develop
 - [ ] FEATURE - Command hooks
   - [ ] prebuild
   - [ ] postbuild
   - [ ] predevelop
   - [ ] postdevelop
   - [ ] prestart
   - [ ] poststart
 - [X] FEATURE - Use config.releaseBranch to control the branch that is used for release generation (defaults to master)
 - [X] FEATURE - Support a 'none' compiler. This is complicated as the NPM publishing process falls over if you symlink a folder. Therefore file copy/paste is the only easy way thusfar.
 - [X] FEATURE - plugin interface for compilers - pre/post publish
 - [X] FEATURE - Plugin architecture for compilers
 - [X] FEATURE - refactor everything into plugins!!
 - [X] FEATURE - develop servers resolved from plugins should resolve into an known API, e.g. { kill: () => Promise }
 - [X] FEATURE - When publish show the projects to publish and ask to confirm?
 - [X] FEATURE - Check if remote has changes to pull
 - [X] FEATURE - Make the target node version configurable.
 - [X] FEATURE - Check if remote exists
 - [X] FEATURE - webpack-dev-server integration for `webapp` types.
 - [ ] TEMPLATE - Application template
 - [ ] TEMPLATE - Empty project
 - [ ] TEST - Polyfill compilation to the following targets
    - [ ] Node
    - [ ] Browser
       - [ ] Chrome
       - [ ] IE 9
       - [ ] Safari
 - [ ] UX - Publish command Error resilience.
 - [ ] UX - Terminal "centerer" https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30335637/get-width-of-terminal-in-node-js
 - [ ] UX - use why-is-node-running for helpful errors?
 - [X] UX - Develop command Error resilience.
   - [X] Startup Errors
   - [X] Compile Time Errors
   - [X] Runtime Errors
 - [X] UX - Add "unhandled promise" error handler to script root.
 - [X] UX - Terminal feedback.
 - [X] UX - Source map support for transpiled bundles.
 - [X] UX - Rename webpack output to match package name so that build output is easier to interpret.
 - [X] UX - Ensure proper webpack error handling https://webpack.js.org/api/node/#error-handling
 - [X] WEBPACK - Use https://github.com/Urthen/case-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin
